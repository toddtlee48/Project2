# Project2
2nd Tech Proj

Project that splits up studentlist information into pages. There are 10 students per page. This project relies on scope of variable 
(both local and global) and dom manipulation. Functions are used to carryout showing the pages of student information. 
Buttons are dynamically included within the javascript file as well to provide the user with navigating between various pages depending on the size of students.
This entire project has been conducted through "vanilla" javascript which means no extra libraries or plugins were used.
